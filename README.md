# STM32F Projects

This repository contains projects for simulating the **STM32F401VET6** microcontroller on **Proteus**. As I am new to embedded systems, I wanted to learn enough before physically obtaining the board by progressing through simulation on a computer. I chose the STM32 series for programming because it has a lot of resources and references available, and also because Proteus supports many boards in this series.
